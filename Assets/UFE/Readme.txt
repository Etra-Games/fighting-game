Universal Fighting Engine 2 (v2.3)

Thank you for purchasing Universal Fighting Engine for Unity 3D
Under the folder UFE\Demos you can find 2 sub-folders: "_2DFighter" and "_3DFighter". Each contains a different template game for UFE (2D and 3D game modes respectively) open the scene file under those folders to start the demo. The global configuration file is under the same folder (Config_Fighter2D.asset or Config_Fighter3D).
Please refer to http://www.ufe3d.com/doku.php/installation or open the installation file (Installation.pdf) for more on initial setup (links to live docs).
